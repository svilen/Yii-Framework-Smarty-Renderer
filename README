## Smarty view render for Yii Framework

If Smarty is a required template engine for your project - do use this view renderer. 

Working with online games and especially PenguinFarmer and using Yii Framework I've been driven to solve a problem with Smarty view renderers available already on the internet.

Fast, efficient and tested on a huge traffik load.

Problems resolved:
1) Why do we need to save the rendered view template? This is a unnecessary disk I/O
2) Why do we need to read the smarty parsed temp file again to parse it as a PHP template? Again unnecessary disk I/O
3) When there is a lot of traffik there is a gap between writing a smarty template and reading it again. So many times there were a blank pages or wrong smarty templates. Even with fast HDDs there we enought time between reads and writes so we can get problems.

After going throught the code, optimizing it and testing I am glad to present you a good and reliable Smarty view renderer for Yii Framework that you can use as a drop in replacement for your current renderer.
